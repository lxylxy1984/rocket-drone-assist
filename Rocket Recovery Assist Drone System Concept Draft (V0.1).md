🚀 Rocket Recovery Assist Drone System Concept Draft (V0.1)

📌 Project Overview

This project proposes a novel method to assist vertical rocket recovery using aerial drone platforms. During the rocket landing phase, autonomous drones temporarily deploy attachment assist structures (such as guide hooks, positioning devices, or soft landing interfaces) to improve the success rate of ground gripping mechanisms (e.g., robotic arms, truss clamps), thereby reducing landing offset errors and enhancing overall reusability.

The core idea is to:

Deploy drones to approach the rocket tail during the final descent phase (last few seconds before touchdown);

Equip drones with lightweight attachment devices (magnetic hooks, soft buffers, laser reflectors, etc.);

Facilitate air-ground collaborative positioning with ground recovery equipment;

Achieve more stable and precise landing point control to assist mechanical capture.

🎯 Core Concepts

Module Description

🚁 Assist Drone Autonomous navigation to the rocket's predicted landing zone, equipped with attachment devices

🔗 Attachment Mechanism Temporary fixation on rocket’s tail cone, landing legs, or reinforced structure areas

📡 Guidance System Visual or laser beacons to assist ground gripping precision

🧲 Coupling Solutions Magnetic, inverse parachute sleeves, telescopic limiters, etc.

⛓️ Release Mechanism Automatic release upon successful ground capture or drone withdrawal

🧪 Preliminary Feasibility Assessment

Aspect Feasibility Judgment

Rocket control accuracy Modern reusable rockets (e.g., Falcon 9, Rocket Lab Electron, Honda test model) have sub-meter control capability

Drone precision & latency Commercial drones have response latency within 50ms, feasible for close approach and attachment

Attachment weight Controlled within hundreds of grams, negligible effect on rocket attitude

Ground collaboration algorithm Laser radar and computer vision can achieve millimeter-level synchronization

🛠️ Application Prospects

🔁 Improve reliability and safety redundancy of rocket recovery;

💰 Reduce structural damage or failure due to landing offsets;

🔍 Future integration with offshore platform landing or unified recovery-preparation-launch systems;

🔄 Modular add-on compatible with various rocket tail interface standards.

📝 Further Ideas

Integrate with computer vision based landing point prediction for automatic path correction;

Multi-drone collaboration (e.g., dual-arm attachment + optical assistance) to increase redundancy;

Extendable to military/civilian dual-use, e.g., precise kinetic interceptor recovery or modular space weapon retrieval;

Open sourcing encourages European or Asia-Pacific small aerospace firms to join development and break Starlink-like monopolies.
